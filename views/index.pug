    h2 About
    p The requirements quality factor ontology is a joint initiative from the requirements quality research community to make the concept of quality factors visible, accessible, and usable. A quality factor is a normative metric which maps a textual requirement of a specific granularity to a scale which informs about the quality of this input. Factors can be evaluated on textual input without any human intervention, which makes them perfect tools for early and integrateable requirements quality assurance.

    h2#communityeffort Community Effort
    p The requirements quality factor ontology is far from complete: on the one hand, improving the structure of the ontology requires including as many perspectives of the requirements quality research community as possible, and on the other hand, identifying all relevant publications which contain eligible objects (factors, data sets, and approaches) for the content of the ontology is an extensive endeavor. Hence, we extend an invitation to a joint community effort.
    p If you are interested in requirements quality and specifically the notion of quality factors, consider contributing to the ontology. We aim at enhancing and maintaining the ontology in order to provide (1) a structure guiding reporting new quality factors and (2) a repository containing existing factors, data sets, and approaches for visibility and easy reuse. In the first step, we need your help to identify relevant publications containing quality factors and related elements. If you are interested, contact us using the button below.
